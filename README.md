## Description
### 1. Start page  
<img src="./re_image/start_1.png" width="380" height="400">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="./re_image/start_2.png" width="380" height="400">  

* When starting the program, all folder isn't specified. (Left)
* Press `SETDIR` at the top and specify Base through OS file manager. (Right)
---
<img src="./re_image/start_3.png" width="380" height="400">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="./re_image/start_4.png" width="380" height="400">  

* After the Base is designated, the folder informantion is output through the GUI, and it can be freely moved through the file path window at the top by double-clicking. (Left)
* Base must be a folder containing `.git` to support git functions. (Right)
---

### 2. Commit  
<img src="./re_image/commit_1.png" width="380" height="400"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="./re_image/commit_2.png" width="380" height="380">  

* Changes have occurred.(when changing folders or file files through an external program, be sure to press `Command` + `R` to refresh.) (Left)
* If you click the element inside the unstaged window at the bottom and press the button, you can use the staging function as normal adaptation. (Right)
---
<img src="./re_image/commit_3.png" width="380" height="400"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="./re_image/commit_4.png" width="380" height="380">  

* The console window of the changed content.(Left)
* If you want to commit the changes, click `COMMIT` at the top.(Right)

<img src="./re_image/commit_5.png" width="380" height="380"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="./re_image/commit_6.png" width="380" height="380">  

* You can commit by entering the CommitMessage, Name, and E-mail. (Left)

### 3. Gitinit  
<img src="./re_image/Init_1.png" width="380" height="380">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="./re_image/Init_2.png" width="380" height="400">  

* This directory is in a completely commited state, that is, in an unmodified state. (Left) 
* There is no `.git` file in the subfolder of that directory, but you can see whether it is gitmanagement or not through Head reference.(Right)
---
<img src="./re_image/Init_3.png" width="380" height="400">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="./re_image/Init_4.png" width="380" height="400">  

* When executed, a pop-up window appears saying that git init is impossible.(Left)
* `.git` is a directory that exists, but has an untracked foder `testin`.(Right)
---
<img src="./re_image/Init_5.png" width="380" height="400">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="./re_image/Init_6.png" width="380" height="400">  

* When you go down to that folder and try git Init, gitInit is not executed by checking the Base folder.(Left)
* However, if the Base folder is set to an untracked subfolder, `.git` can be created through gitInit.(Right)
---

### 4. Fileopen
<img src="./re_image/fileopen_1.png" width="380" height="380">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="./re_image/fileopen_2.png" width="380" height="400">  

* When double-clicking a file in the GUI, the file manager screen opens. 
* The file manager is open when it is under GIT management(Left), but not open when it is not under GIT management(Right).
* Only one admin option can be set, and it works based on Git commands such as `git rm`, `git restore`.
* However, if you select Rename and do not enter a name to change, the change will not be applied.

## Wireframe
![깃와이어프레임](https://github.com/OSW23CAU21/OSW21_GIT_CLIENT/assets/108653152/da455a9c-a975-4124-ae80-b2dcf4d6e15a)




## Bugs. 
1. when you set Base directory in Git space, BaseName is not branch name. 
2. when you executes files in workspace sometimes it not opens properly. (getting .id error). 
3. when you opening added file to see git diff, error occurs 
-> solved by changing 'added', 'untracking' files openable status to false 
-> We think alert to when user try to open new files in git space


## for future supports. 
1. Developing WorkSpace File actions (Rename, Delete, CreateFile, CreateFolders)
2. Developing Gitspace File Actions (To Unstaged, To Staged)
3. Adding Git Inits to Switch Fab button following under conditions. 
    - when Base folder is not managed by git, must be plus Iconn (not apple or github)
    - when you clicks + buttons git Initiation will be executed. (same as create .git)
4. Switching three fab buttons by Switch Fab conditions. 
    - If we are in workspace User will access Three buttons (git_clone, branch managing, refresh) ## is MVP
    - If we are in gitspace User will accces Three buttons (commit, gitPush, gitPull) ## not MVP
5. saving User Infos by Encryption (folderchain, base's rootpath, Author name, Author email, access token to github)
6. loading User Infos by decryption
